    "# OpenAIAgent with Playgrounds Subgraph Inspector\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PlaygroundsSubgraphInspectorToolSpec` is a tool designed for LLM agnets to seamlessly interface, query, introspect and analyze the schema of any subgraphs deployed on The Graph's decentralized network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries are facilitated via the [Playgrounds API](https://playgrounds.network/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Playgrounds API is a service provided by [Playgrounds Analytics](https://playgrounds.network) to streamline interfacing with decentralized subgraphs (indexed blockchain datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration with Decentralized Subgraphs**: Access decentralized datasets without the complexities of wallet or GRT management.\n",
    "- **OpenAI x Blockchain Data**: Harness the power of OpenAI's language models to interpret and analyze blockchain data.\n",
    "- **Rich Context**: Introspection provides the LLM agents with rich contextual understanding on subgraphs being queried. This in turn enhances the agents ability to generate insights on the underlying dataset indexed by the subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool has been designed to function seamlessly with [Llama index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) or [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAIAgent, when used with the `PlaygroundsSubgraphInspectorToolSpec`, offers a robust method to fetch and decipher data from decentralized subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- An OpenAI API key.\n",
    "- [A Playgrounds API key](https://app.playgrounds.network/signup)\n",
    "- [A subgraph identifier or deployment ID](https://thegraph.com/explorer)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try introspecting the Uniswap V3 subgraph."
