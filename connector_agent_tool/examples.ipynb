    "# OpenAIAgent with Playgrounds Subgraph Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll dive into how you can use the OpenAIAgent in combination with the `PlaygroundsSubgraphConnector` to query data from the Uniswap V3 subgraph via the Playgrounds API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use any desired decentralized subgraph on the graph network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of this tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy access to Decentralized Subgraphs (Datasets)**: No need for wallet or GRT management.\n",
    "- **LLM x Blockchain data**: Develop Ai applications that leverage blockchain data seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is specifically designed to be used alongside [Llama index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) or [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAIAgent allows developers to integrate a diverse range of tools and data sources with OpenAI's language models. When combined with the PlaygroundsSubgraphConnector, you can easily fetch and analyze data from decentralized subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "An API key from OpenAI.\n",
    "An API key from Playgrounds.\n",
    "A subgraph identifier or deployment ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To learn more about Playgrounds API, please visit our website : https://playgrounds.network/\n",
    "- Obtain you Playgrounds API Key and get started for free here: https://app.playgrounds.network/signup\n",
    "- Find any Subgraph (dataset) you need here: https://thegraph.com/explorer\n"
